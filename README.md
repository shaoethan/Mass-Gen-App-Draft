# Accelerometer & Gyroscope Activity Recorder

This is a React Native app built with Expo that records accelerometer and gyroscope data for standard activities of daily life (ADL). Users enter a subject name, choose a treatment condition (before or after), and record data for activities like walking, sitting, going upstairs, or downstairs.

The collected data is uploaded to Firebase and is used for training activity recognition models and analyzing movement patterns of chronic pain before and after chronic pain treatments to evaluate treatment effectiveness.
