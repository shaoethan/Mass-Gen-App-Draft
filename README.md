# Accelerometer Activity Recorder

This is a React Native app built with Expo that records accelerometer data for different physical activities. Users enter a subject name, choose a treatment condition (before or after), and record data for activities like walking, sitting, going upstairs, or downstairs.

The collected data is uploaded to Firebase and is used for training activity recognition models and analyzing movement patterns before and after treatments, to analyze pain in patients.
